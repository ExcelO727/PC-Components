    <h3>Cooling</h3>
    <h4>Fans</h4>
    <p>
      There are many components that generate heat such as the CPU, GPU, Power
      Supply, and many others. These components are the reason why cooling is
      very important in a PC, and is crucial for the PC to have along life span
      and survive for a long time. While every component does generate heat,
      some generate more heat than others. These components need their own
      dedicated cooling systems so they do not over heat and burn out the
      computer. Some of these components that need their own cooling systems are
      the CPU, GPU, and Power Supply. These 3 are the components that generate
      the most heat on their own and need cooling systems seperate from the main
      case fans that are used for the entire PC.
