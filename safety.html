    <h4>Electrostatic Discharge</h4>
    <p>
      Electrostatic discharge is when static electricity builds up on one
      surface, putting it off balance, then it transfers onto another surface to
      balance out the charge causing a shock that is able to fry PC components
      if you do not take the proper procedures to protect against ESD.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for humans the feel the classic shock that you feel when you
      touch and inbalanced metal object, there needs to be at least 1500 volts
      of ESD, but this number is much lower for PC components, being less than
      10 volts before a PC component can get fried. This is why it is so
      dangerous to work on PC components without proper antistatic gear, since a
      components could get fried and we would not even feel it.
    </p>
    <h4>How to protect against ESD</h4>
    <p>
      There are 4 ways to protect against ESD when working with PC components.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Antistatic Wristbands</li>
      <li>Antistatic Workbenches</li>
      <li>Antistatic Bags</li>
      <li>Antistatic Mats</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Antistatic Wristbands</h5>
    <p>
      Antistatic wristbands are straps that you put on your hand before working
      inside a PC or with PC components. There is a clip at the end of the
      wristband that has to attach to a part of the PC case that is not painted.
      This lets it take the static electricity that could generate in the PC and
      put it into your hand where it can not harm you.
