    <h3>Safety</h3>
    <h4>General Safety</h4>
    <p>
      When working on or just using a PC in general, there are multiple safety
      steps that need to be taken in order for you or the PC to not be harmed.
    </p>
    <p>Some of these include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearing clutter around your area</li>
      <li>Not eating or drinking near the PC</li>
      <li>Removing all jewelry or watches</li>
      <li>Keep a fire extinguisher beside the PC at all times</li>
      <li>Wear ESD gear</li>
      <li>Tape exposed sharp edges</li>
      <li>Wear eye protection</li>
      <li>Use proper lifting procedures</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Electrostatic Discharge</h4>
    <!-- 
      An image tag lets you imbed another image from another website.
      There are some nessecary attributes needed in order for the tag
      to work like "src" which shows the tag what source the image is 
      coming from. Width and height are also needed to determine how 
      long the image is horizontally and vertically. The "alt" attribute
      is used for people with screen readers. You need to describe the 
      image in enough detail in order for someone with a screen reader 
      will not have to see the image, but still understand what it is 
      about.

    <p>
      Electrostatic discharge is when static electricity builds up on one
      surface, putting it off balance, then it transfers onto another surface to
      balance out the charge causing a shock that is able to fry PC components
      if you do not take the proper procedures to protect against ESD.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for humans the feel the classic shock that you feel when you
      touch and inbalanced metal object, there needs to be at least 1500 volts
      of ESD, but this number is much lower for PC components, being less than
      10 volts before a PC component can get fried. This is why it is so
      dangerous to work on PC components without proper antistatic gear, since a
      components could get fried and we would not even feel it.
    </p>
    <h4>How to protect against ESD</h4>
    <p>
      There are 4 ways to protect against ESD when working with PC components.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Antistatic Wristbands</li>
      <li>Antistatic Workbenches</li>
      <li>Antistatic Mats</li>
      <li>Antistatic Bags</li>
    </ul>
    <img />
    <h5>Antistatic Wristbands</h5>
    <img
      src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TcCqPP0QL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg"
      width="350px"
      height="290px"
      alt="A picture of a hand with an antistatic wristband on it." />
    <p>
      Antistatic wristbands are straps that you put on your hand before working
      inside a PC or with PC components. There is a clip at the end of the
      wristband that has to attach to a part of the PC case that is not painted.
      This lets it take the static electricity that could generate in the PC and
      put it into your hand where it can not harm you.
    </p>
    <h5>Antistatic Workbenches</h5>
    <img
      src="https://imrorwxhikrnlm5q-static.micyjz.com/cloud/lkBpjKpnlmSRpirprrpriq/TF10-1120-1120.jpg"
      width="350px"
      height="290px"
      alt="Image of an antistatic workbench." />
    <p>
      Antistatic workbenches help ground PC components just like the wristbands.
      The difference is that the workbenches do not go on your body, they go on
      the counter or table that you are working on. This can help when you have
      light items that you are working on like lighter PCs, or anything that
      isnt too heavy.
    </p>
    <h5>Antistatic Mats</h5>
    <img
      src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iyc-sd+AL.jpg"
      width="350px"
      height="290px"
      alt="A picture of an antistatic mat." />
    <p>
      Antistatic mats are just like antistatic workbenches but instead of
      staying on a counter or a table, it stays on the floor. This can be useful
      when working on heavier items that can not be lifted off the floor and
      placed on a table.
    </p>
    <h5>Antistatic Bags</h5>
    <img
      src="https://www.edcosupply.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/01-antistatic-bags-vs-static-shielding-bags-how-are-they-different.jpg"
      width="350px"
      height="290px"
      alt="A picture of an antistatic bag with a PC components going into it." />
    <p>
      When taking PC components out of the case, it is necessary to put them all
      in antistatic bags, because although you are not touching the PC
      component, they could still be affected by ESD because of the surface of
      object that it is placed on. This could still fry the component, and cause
      you to have to buy a whole new component.

    <h4>Fire Safety</h4>
    <p>
      When using a fire extinguisher, there is one acronym to always remember:
      PASS -
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pull the pin</li>
      <li>Aim at the base of the fire</li>
      <li>Squeeze the lever/handle</li>
      <li>Sweep from side to side</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      There are multiple different types of extinguishers for different types of
      fires. An extinguisher that is made for electrical fires can't be used on
      gas fires, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to know that the label for what the extinguisher is always
      located on the big label on the fire extinguisher, right below the
      instructions that tell you how to properly use the fire extinguisher.
