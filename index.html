    <h1>Website about PC Components</h1>
    <h2>All you need to know about PC Components</h2>
    <!-- 
      This subheading is h3 because the h2 tag was already
      used on the subheading after the main heading.

      This seperates them and makes it easy for anyone 
      using the website to determine whether the two are related.
    -->
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <!-- 
      The h4 tag is used here since it is a subheading for the Introduction
      heading.
    -->
    <h4>What this website is about</h4>
    <!-- 
      The p tag or paragraph tag lets you make a line or a paragraph
      of text, to explain whatever you are talking about.
    -->
    <p>
      This website will be explaining everything you need to know when it comes
      to working with PC components like safety, internal components, and just
      using PC components in general.
    </p>
    <!-- 
      I put another h4 instead of an h5 tag because I am adding a new subheading
      for the Introduction heading instead of a subheading for the previous h4
      tag.
    -->
    <h4>What this website will be covering</h4>

    <p>
      This website will be covering multiple aspects of working with PC
      components, and PC components themselves. Things such as safety, the CPU,
      the motherboard, the GPU, PC cases, cooling systems, etc.
