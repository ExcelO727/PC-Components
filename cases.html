    <h3>Cases</h3>
    <h4>PC Cases</h4>
    <p>
      Every single PC component has to be inside the case. The case grounds all
      the components, protecting them from ESD and also keeps them safe from
      getting damaged from external sources. The case comes in different sizes,
      these are called form factors. There are 4 common form factors these being
      horizontal case, full size, compact, and all-in-one.

      Horizontal cases are cases that are set up when the monitor is placed on
      top of the PC. They are usually used in tight office spaces where there is
      not much space available to use. The horizontal case lets the user be able
      to have a computer while having some left over spacefor other items also.

    <p>
      Full size cases are very large cases that are bigger than normal PCs, and
      have much more space than usual, allowing more room for upgrading PC
      components later on if needed. Although full size cases have a large
      amount of space, they take up a lot of space on the table you are using
      them, so you would need a large storage space if you wanted to get a full
      size case.

    <p>
      Compact cases are essentially the same as full size cases. They sit apart
      from the monitor, and have their own individual components inside. The
      difference between a full size case and a compact case is the size. As the
      name suggests, a compact case is smaller than a full size case, limiting
      the amount of upgrades you can make to the components inside. Since the
      compact case does not have as much space as the full size and is mostly
      made to fit the size of the original components it comes with, if you
      wanted to upgrade to a better component, which most of the time includes
      the component also becoming bigger, it would be much more difficult to
      upgrade than it would be with a full size case.

      All-in-one cases combine the monitor and the PC in one. All the necessary
      components are stored in the back of the monitor, which allows the monitor
      to run on its own without needing a phsyical PC that connects to the
      monitor.
