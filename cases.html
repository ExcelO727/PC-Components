    <h3>Cases</h3>
    <h4>PC Cases</h4>
    <p>
      Every single PC component has to be inside the case. The case grounds all
      the components, protecting them from ESD and also keeps them safe from
      getting damaged from external sources. The case comes in different sizes,
      these are called form factors. There are 4 common form factors these being
      horizontal case, full size, compact, and all-in-one.

    <p>
      Horizontal cases are cases that are set up when the monitor is placed on
      top of the PC. They are usually used in tight office spaces where there is
      not much space available to use. The horizontal case lets the user be able
      to have a computer while having some left over spacefor other items also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full size cases are very large cases that are bigger than normal PCs, and
      have much more space than usual, allowing more room for upgrading PC
      components later on if needed. Although full size cases have a large
      amount of space, they take up a lot of space on the table you are using
      them, so you would need a large space if you wanted to get a full size
      case.
